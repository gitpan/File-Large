=head1 NAME

File::Large - Large and giant text file performance reader

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use File::Large;

	# create new object with default options, block size 20MB and ANSI text file
	my $fileobj = File::Large->new(file=>$filename);
	
	# or create new object with custom options, set block size 50MB and UTF-8 text file
	my $fileobj = File::Large->new(file=>$filename, block_size=>50_000_000, utf8=>1);
	
	# now loop through all the text file lines straight forward
	
	my $counter = 0;
	while (my $line = $fileobj->line()) {#loop through the file lines sequentially
		$counter++;
		# print "$counter)- $line\n";
	}
	$fileobj->close(); # close the file and frees the memory used for the block
	print "$counter lines found\n";
	
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module solves the problem with reading large and huge text files in Perl. It is designed to read only block by block as needed.
It does not load the whole file into memory, it only reads one block at a time and once the last sequential line reached, it reads the
next block from the file and frees the previous block from memory, so at all times only one block of the file is kept in menory.

For example if you are reading a 2GB file, once you start reading lines from the file, the module reads the first block from the
file on disk, while you loop through the lines, when you reach the line at the end of the read block, the module delete this block
from memory and read the next block from the file on disk and parses it to lines and so on.
